# CDC_DL_2022
CDC Short Course on Deep Learning

The course materials are in two folders and a Word file. 

Folder "data": Will need it when running the simulations

Folder "lectures": Each of the six subfolders corresponds to each of the six modules. The .pptx file is the main lecture slides. The .ipynb files are demonstrations in Jupyter Notebook. The sixth folder contains a text file of software requirement, and a .ckpt file which is generated by running a Python code. 

The Word file "CourseInfo.docx" gives the course information.
